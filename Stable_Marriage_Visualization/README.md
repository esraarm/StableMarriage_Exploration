# Stable Marriage Visualization

## Overview
Stable Marriage Visualization is a Python project designed to explain and visually demonstrate the Stable Marriage Problem. The project provides educational step-by-step visualizations with color-coded segments to help users understand the concepts and algorithms behind stable matching.

## Contents
- `main.py`: The main program that loads graph data, prints visualizations, and guides users through the Stable Marriage Problem.
- `graph.py`: Contains the `GraphCell` class and related functions for representing and displaying cells in the terminal.
- `colors.py`: Defines color codes for terminal output, used to highlight different cell states (e.g., proposed, engaged).
- `graphs.JSON`: Stores the graph data for various matching scenarios, including the states of each cell (proposed, engaged).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Educate users about the Stable Marriage Problem and its applications.
- Provide clear, step-by-step visualizations of the matching process.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the main program from the project root:
   ```
   py Stable_Marriage_Visualization/main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts and view the visualizations in your terminal.
