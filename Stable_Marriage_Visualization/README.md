# Stable Marriage Visualization

## Overview
Stable Marriage Visualization is a project designed to explain and visually demonstrate the Stable Marriage Problem. The project provides educational step-by-step visualizations with color-coded segments to help users understand the concepts behind stable matching using the Gale Shapley Algorithm.

## Contents
- `Stable_Marriage_Visualization.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook used to execute the program.
- `graphs.json`: Graph information needed for the visualization portion of the project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Educate users about the Stable Marriage Problem and its applications.
- Provide clear, step-by-step visualizations of the matching process.

## How to Run
1. Download the `graphs.json` file.
2. In the Google Colab notebook, run the cell titled "Import JSON File Containing Graph Information" and select `graphs.json` from your downloaded files.
3. Run all other cells **before** running "Driver for Visualization". These cells set up all the information needed by the driver.
4. Run "Driver for Visualization" and follow the prompts to view the explanations and visualizations!
