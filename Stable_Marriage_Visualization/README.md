# Stable Marriage Visualization

## Overview
This project is designed to explain and visually demonstrate the Stable Marriage Problem. The project provides educational step-by-step visualizations with color-coded segments to help users understand the concepts behind stable matching using the Gale Shapley Algorithm.

## Contents
- `README.d`: This markdown file containing important information about the project.
- `Visualization.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook used to execute the program.
- `graphs.json`: Graph information needed for the visualization portion of the project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Educate users about the Stable Marriage Problem and its applications.
- Provide clear, step-by-step visualizations of the matching process.

## View Output
If you wish to view the output of this project you can either:
- Look at `Visualization.ipynb`: Contains the code and all output from the Google Colab notebook.
- Run the Google Colab notebook on your own machine. Steps below.

## How to Run
1. Download the `graphs.json` file.
2. In `Visualization.ipynb`, click the button at the top of the file called "Open in Colab".
3. In the Google Colab notebook, run the cell titled "Import JSON File Containing Graph Information" under "Get Data and select `graphs.json` from your downloaded files.
4. Run all other cells **before** running "Driver for Visualization". These cells set up all the information needed by the driver.
5. Run "Driver for Visualization" under "Run Driver" and follow the prompts to view the explanations and visualizations at your own pace!
