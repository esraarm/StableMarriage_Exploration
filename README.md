# StableMarriage_Exploration
Term project for CSC 2400 - Design of Algorithms. Explore different algorithms used to solve the Stable Marriage Problem and some of its related problems.

**Team Members:** 
[Cydney Miller](https://github.com/CydMiller), [Maddison Barnwell](https://github.com/Mbarnwell-ai), [Esraa Marfing](https://github.com/esraarm), and [David Owotomo Oluwadara](https://github.com/oluwadaraowotomo)

### Project Goals
- Design and conduct an experiment to test different algorithms used to solve the Stable Marriage Problem
- Conduct theoretical and empirical analysis of Stable Marriage algorithm implementations
- Collaborate with a team on a large-scale project with clear deliverables
- Navigate roadblocks professionally in preparation for real-world work
