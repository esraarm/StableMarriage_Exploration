# StableMarriage_Exploration
Term project for CSC 2400 - Design of Algorithms. Explore different algorithms used to solve the Stable Marriage Problem and some of its related problems.

**Team Members:** 
[Cydney Miller](https://github.com/CydMiller), [Maddison Barnwell](https://github.com/Mbarnwell-ai), [Esraa Marfing](https://github.com/esraarm), and [David Owotomo Oluwadara](https://github.com/oluwadaraowotomo)

### Project Goals
- Design and conduct an experiment to test different algorithms used to solve the Stable Marriage Problem
- Conduct theoretical and empirical analysis of Stable Marriage algorithm implementations
- Collaborate with a team on a large-scale project with clear deliverables
- Navigate roadblocks professionally in preparation for real-world work

### Contents
- `Stable_Marriage_Visualization`: This folder contains an educational tool to introduce the Stable Marriage Problem and how it is solved using the Gale Shapley algorithm.
- `README.md`: This markdown file containing important information about this project.
- `Stable_Marriage.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook used for our experiment. If you would like a closer look at how this notebook was designed and seeing it run in action, watch the tour video [here](https://youtu.be/wmR0Yy7uR70).
- `Stable Marriage Problem Project Presentation`: Powerpoint PDF that summarizes our project and its results.
- `Stable Marriage Problem Project Report`: Word PDF that gives a detailed account of our project and experimentation procedure with results and interpretation.

### Difficulties/Lessons Learned
This project taught us not only about the Stable Marriage Problem, but also about time management and effective communication. Our biggest challenge was definitely organizing times to meet due to conflicting schedules, so we had to overcome this obstacle by having meetings with only a few of our memebrs and creating meeting summaries for those who could not attend. Throughout the entirety of our project we reminded each other to reach out if there were any questions or roadblocks and rely on one another for help. It was challenging, but everyone was able to deliver on their parts of the project for an overall successful result. We will take these lessons with us in our future endeavors, as well as the technical knowledge we learned along the way!
